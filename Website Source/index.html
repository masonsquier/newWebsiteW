        <h1> A poem I decided to write for ya'll, welcome to the gay klux klan!</h1>
        I hate that feeling, the anticipation of death.

It's always a waiting game, wondering when you will meet your fate.
If you end up having a good day, and you don't pass away, then you can't relive those 24 hours, you were alive for.
You can wake up the next day, and do exactly the same things you did yesterday, but something out of your control
can still end up killing you.

I sorta hate having good days, because it almost sets a trend of you believing the next day 
will go just as well
until it doesn't
You get told you have cancer, or you get a fatal sickness, or worse you die
so my solution, is to suck as much dick as you can, eat as much nigga ass as possible 
cause you never know when your last cumshot is
